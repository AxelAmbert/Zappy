Epitech Network/AI/GUI project

The goal of the project was to :
1 - Create a C server that takes request from the client (AI).
2 - Create a C++ AI that will leave in a generated world, and that have to fight in teams against other AIs.
3 - Design a GUI to see what happen in the world thanks to the SFML library.
